      <div id="blog"><p id="para_0_original"><!-- wp:heading -->
</p><h2><strong>1.Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI is the future. It has been said that AI will be mankind's last invention. But it has also been said that 50% of current jobs will be done by AI in the year 2035. I can assure you this industry will be booming before then. I can guarantee you that this industry will survive even after true AI is born. True AI will be capable of self learning and self awareness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>2. Deep &amp; Machine Learning</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not be mistaken Deep Learning is different from Machine Learning. Now deep learning is  a subset of machine learning modeled loosely on the neural pathways of the human brain. <em>Deep</em>  refers to the multiple layers between the input and output layers. In  deep learning, the algorithm&nbsp;automatically learns what features are  useful. Common deep learning techniques include convolutional neural  networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (such as long short-term  memory, or LSTM), and deep Q networks.  While we use <em>machine learning</em> as shorthand for “traditional machine  learning” the workflow in which you manually select&nbsp;features and then  train the model. When we refer to <em>machine learning</em> we exclude deep learning. Common machine learning techniques include decision  trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>3. Robotics</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robotics is also the future. Think prosthetic, AI's body, organ replacement, man and machine bonding, among many others. I believe this industry has already began with biohackers. It is however yet to become popular probably due to unprocessed materials eg chips, hydraulics, graphene, sensory imitation technology among others, but be sure that this industry will rise before 2025.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>4. Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the current number of threats that exist and the new ones being created cybersecurity and ethical hacking isn't going anywhere.<br>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyber attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive  information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. While Ethical Hacking is a term used to describe hacking performed by a company or individual to help identify potential threats  on a computer or network. An ethical hacker attempts to bypass system security and search for any weak points that could be exploited by malicious hackers. This information is then used by the organization to improve the system security, to minimize or eliminate any potential attacks. With the current number of threats that exist and the new ones being created.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>5. web development</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why this? Around 700 businesses are open everyday. Each of these businesses require an online presence. Social Media alone ain't going to cut it. They need a website, hence the reason why web development will stick around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>6. Graphic/ui/ux design</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is key especially UI/UX. It has seen a huge growth in demand from 2017. Apps need a beautiful and interactive user interface. One can never go wrong with this. Especially paired with graphics design. Soon the demand will be high. Pairing Graphics/UI/UX and Animation will definitely get you noticed and picked. In 2018 we saw an increase with companies going after animation ads instead of the regular acted ads. Let's not forget it's cheaper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>7. Nanotechnology</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why this? Sadly cancer and tumors are on the rise. We are in urgent need of little men with powerful concentrated lasers or slicing tools. Who better to do it than nano-tech. I once did a term paper on this but my lecturer thought i was way to crazy and that this is all from Sci-Fi movies. But this is real. And exists. It has bridged I.T to Medicine better than any other thing. Tangible progress has been made but we are still to far from having little friends to help us get rid of those tumors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are more than 700 specializations in Information Communication Technology. I only covered the ones gaining traction. These are likely to continue growing in demand until it is met. Well that is it for today. Have a lovely day.</p>
