</p><p>To begin, i need to mention that Windows Defender is doing a pretty good job at protecting your Windows 10 computer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So all you need is a second option malware scanner. One that doesn't take the role of your main antivirus but comes with all/some of the features to become one. One of such is <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes</a>, the current best second option antivirus. It has both a business and home version. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home version comes with a 15 day trial, in which all the services are free and mostly automated. It scans your computer daily. Alerts you when browsing a malicious website etc as i mentioned above it can do everything a regular antivirus can sometimes even better. This together with Windows Defender and you have a pretty well secured computer/laptop. However once the trial is done, you'll either need to buy the full version or settle with the free version which has most of it's features turned off. Meaning you'll need to be running scans by yourself, regularly. If you dont want that then here is a list of the best free antivirus software around according to <a href="https://www.av-test.org/en/">AV-TEST</a>, a company that tests antivirus software with real live tests. Then rate them according to their performance, battery drain and overall score at beating malwares and viruses. Since these tests are run regularly you can be rest assured that whichever you choose might protect you from zero day exploits and most of the modern malware developed. To quote from their about page:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now to the antivirus softwares that have maintained their level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NB: A remainder</strong> all of these are free, they might come with a trial run of their more equipped and powerful pro versions but once the trial is over, you are guaranteed at least 94% protection against malware, trojans, ransomware and worms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> My current choice products for free antivirus utility  are Avast Free Antivirus and Kaspersky Free. Avast gets very good scores from the independent labs, and Kaspersky took near-perfect scores in  recent tests. On the other hand, Avast includes some useful bonus  features not found in Kaspersky, including a password manager  and a network security scanner. If you do have a little cash in your budget for security, the best paid antivirus software does offer more  and better protection. If not, try a few of these free tools and see  which one you like best. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>AVAST FREE ANTIVIRUS</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Very  good scores from independent testing labs and our hands-on tests.  Network security inspector. Password manager. Many useful,  security-related bonus features. Free.<br><strong>Cons: </strong>Password manager features limited. Some bonus features require separate purchase.<br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Avast  Free Antivirus combines an antivirus engine that scores very well in  testing with a surprisingly extensive collection of bonus features.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>KARSPERSKY FREE</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Perfect  scores from four independent testing labs. Perfect score in our  phishing protection test. Good scores in our malware-blocking and  malicious URL blocking tests. Free<br><strong>Cons: </strong>No direct tech support. RAM and Battery consumption issue but they seem to be working on it<br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Kaspersky  Free offers full-scale malware protection that gets perfect scores from  the independent labs, and it won't cost you a penny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>AVG Antivirus Free</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Very good scores in multiple independent lab tests and our own hands-on tests.<br><strong>Cons: </strong>Initial scan slower than average. No longer offers web protection browser extension.<br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>AVG  AntiVirus Free offers precisely the same antivirus protection engine as  Avast Free Antivirus, but lacks the impressive collection of bonus  features that you get with Avast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>BITDEFENDER ANTIVIRUS FREE EDITION</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Same antivirus protection as for-pay Bitdefender. Excellent scores from independent testing labs. Top antiphishing score.<br><strong>Cons: </strong>Lacks all features of the for-pay Bitdefender beyond core antivirus protection.<br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Bitdefender  Antivirus Free Edition includes precisely the same antivirus technology  found in the commercial Bitdefender Antivirus, without the paid  edition's many useful bonus features.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Check Point ZoneAlarm Free Antivirus+</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Antivirus protection licensed from Kaspersky. Tough, effective two-way firewall. Free. Bonus features.<br><strong>Cons: </strong>No  antivirus lab test results. Lacks some antivirus features. No  protection for malicious or fraudulent websites. Behavioral detection  tars good and bad programs in testing. Personal data protection fails in  testing.<br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Check  Point ZoneAlarm Free Antivirus+ combines Kaspersky-powered antivirus  with an effective firewall, but it lacks protection against malicious  and fraudulent websites, and some of its bonus features don't work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>BONUS: AhnLab V3 Internet Security</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> V3 Internet Security  is an Advanced Security Software. It works Best for detecting the Virus  through continuous System Monitoring. This Software Interface has  System Security, Email Protection, and System Tuning Tool with Few more  Small Tools embedded in each of these Features. Anti-Spyware, Web  Security, Mail Security, Firewall, USB External Drive are the Important  Features of the AhnLab V3 Internet Security. Of all the Tools, V3  Internet Security works best to reduce the usage of System Resources. It  performs a Fast and Perfect Virus Scan to detect the entire virus  infected file in the System. <br>At the time of writing this post AhnLab is number 1 in the <a href="https://www.av-test.org/en/">AV-TEST</a>. In my opinion, it's interface(At least the one i used an year ago) is/was quite challenging. Maybe they changed i would encourage you to go check it out. </p>
