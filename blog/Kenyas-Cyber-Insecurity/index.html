</p><p>Hey guys, i am back again with another article, and today i want to touch a bit on Kenya's Cybersecurity issue. Most of us have heard the NEWS, Kenya has a major cybersecurity issue. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Kenya has the highest internet penetration in Africa with over <a href="https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Internet-access-grows-in-Kenya/1056-3895304-nsw0nnz/index.html">31 million people</a> having access to the internet, according to a report by Jumia Business Intelligence and GSMA Mobile. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With more and more Kenyans<a href="https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Internet-access-grows-in-Kenya/1056-3895304-nsw0nnz/index.html"> being able to access the internet</a> from mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, also comes the rise of mobile money transactions, access to loans and economic prosperity for the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE:</span></strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The country has only 1,700 certified cybercrime  professionals, too few to secure the Kenyan population of close to 50  million against cyber-attacks on the rise.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Some 10.2 million threats were detected in the last three  months of 2018, over 2,200 times the 4,589 recorded in the same period  the previous year.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>President Uhuru Kenyatta last week launched the country’s  Digital Economy Blueprint at the Transform Africa Summit in Kigali,  Rwanda, the first in Africa.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with the acceleration of&nbsp;digitization comes insecure consumer habits and easy targets. This coupled with a lack of coherent legislation and regulatory  frameworks, as well as inadequate cybersecurity measures in key sectors,  is turning Kenya into a lucrative target for cyber criminals aka Hackers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> As digital consumers, we use the internet every day in order to access  social media, do personal or business banking, book a holiday, and get  the latest updates on news and sporting events. We perform so many tasks  using the internet, believing that it is safe, that we tend to neglect  the security and preventative measures to lock out phishing scams and cyber criminals. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The country has been targeted by&nbsp;<a href="https://businesstoday.co.ke/how-alex-mutuku-drowned-in-his-own-success-as-hacker/">hackers</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001233552/man-charged-with-hacking-kra-and-causing-sh4b-loss">several</a>&nbsp;major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001240392/19-kenyan-firms-hit-by-costly-ransomware-cyber-attack">attacks</a> over the past couple of years, and in 2017 Kenya lost approximately <a href="https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/2018/04/kenya-lost-sh21-2b-cyber-security-2017/">Sh21.2 billion to hackers alone.</a> Should i include the scams, stolen money, fake projects, no i will not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Kenya is facing a potentially huge cyber-insecurity problem with at least 3000 successful or failed attacks recorded every month.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now it should be noted that hackers read newspapers. And Kenya has a big ol target on it's back. Now hackers love targets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last
 year the infamous ransomware attack WannaCrypt hit the NHS and other 
systems around the world, bringing down critical services. It impacted 
over 230,000 computers and to this day constitutes one of the largest 
ever cyber-attacks. According to Microsoft’s latest <a href="http://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-AU-CNTNT-eBook-Security-GDPR-Microsoft-SIR-Volume-23%5B1%5D.pdf">Security Intelligence Report</a>, ransomware continues to be a popular method used by cybercriminals to solicit money from victims. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At least <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001240392/19-kenyan-firms-hit-by-costly-ransomware-cyber-attack">19 companies in Kenya</a> were been hit by the WannaCrypt attack. Most of the devices affected were surprisingly Windows XP, Vista and 7. <br>Vista? XP? Come on Kenya, we can do better than that. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's not forget that the most affected were Governments, Hospitals, Financial Institutions, Homes, Universities and colleges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe i may have a solution. But before i get into that, i would like to list down some of the common attacks that Kenyans fall into. But first</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is Cybercrime? It is as any offense  that is committed using a computer, network or hardware device. It is  not a new occurrence, but its scope is constantly evolving. Once cyber  criminals have your personal details, they gain access to an abundance  of information that will allow them to clone just about any account that  is tied to you. This includes: credit cards, investment bonds, personal  savings accounts, as well as cheque accounts. The list does not stop  there as your entire identity can be stolen within seconds. Definition by tech company, Symantec.</p>

<h3>Hacking Techniques </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Social Engineering</strong> - This invokes taking advantage of the human beings emotions, psychology and habits. <br>Social engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up  confidential information. The types of information these criminals are  seeking can vary, but when individuals are targeted the criminals are  usually trying to trick you into giving them your passwords or bank  information, or access your computer to secretly install malicious  software–that will give them access to your passwords and bank  information as well as giving them control over your computer. <br>Criminals use social engineering tactics because it is usually easier  to exploit your natural inclination to trust than it is to discover  ways to hack your software. &nbsp;For example, it is much easier to fool  someone into giving you their password than it is for you to try hacking  their password (unless the password is really weak).<br>The weakest link in an organization is not their computers but their employees.<br>Types of attacks: Phishing, Pretexting and Baiting.<br>Some of the ways this is used in Kenya is eg. Those messages you get telling you you have won. This is applicable to Emails as well. I'll mention the preventive measures below this section.<br></li><li><strong>DoS and DDoS Attacks(Distributed/Denial of Service)</strong> - This method is one of the most common hacking techniques used by both  novice and sophisticated hackers. In this hacking technique, the hacker  loads the server with unnecessary traffic leading to Denial of Service  (DoS) for authentic users. <br>The hacker may deploy DDoS attack by  using artificial tools like dummy computers or bots to continue  launching the server with fake requests to overload it. It leads to the  attacked website or webpage unavailable for "real users."<br></li><li><strong>Keylogging</strong> - Keylogging  is a hacking technique where the malicious hacker deploys a software  called keylogger on your system. <br>This software records every keystroke  and stores the information in a log file which the hacker can look into  for sniffing sensitive information like your username and passwords for  online accounts.<br>It is a dangerous hack that can cause identity theft and bank frauds.<br></li><li><strong>Cookie Stealer</strong> - Cookies on your browser offer great ease with quick access to  frequent sites. <br>The main idea behind cookies is that they store your  personal information including username, password and the site  information you visit.Once the hacker steals cookies from your  browser, they can even authenticate themselves as you and log in to your  online accounts like Facebook, twitter, etc. <br>Another noteworthy thing  is how cookies theft has also become more comfortable. <br>With the  sophisticated algorithms and software, a hacker can download the  software, and within few clicks, they will have all your details in front of them.<br></li><li><strong>Bait and Switch</strong> - An  ancient and conventional technique used by the hackers is bait and  switch. The hackers ask the user (victim) to download or run software or  an app on their system that seems non-malicious, but there is inbuilt  spam or malicious software.<br>In  simple words, they may use free software as bait, and once you click,  they'll switch you onto the malicious link that will put your data at  risk.<br><br><br><br>These are but a few there are more than 300 hacking techniques in the world today. And that number is rapidly increasing. Hackers are coming up with advanced techniques.</li></ol>

<h3>Possible Fix For Kenya and other countries</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> According to Kaspersky, Algeria is leading in Africa in terms of  cybercrime and web threats ahead of Egypt, South Africa and Kenya. Why not copy and implement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe we need a dedicated team of cyber "police". Ordinary police can't solve cyber crimes. We need a team of ethical hackers and info/cybersecurity pros. All we really need is to train people and of course hire those who are already skilled. Just think about how we would reduce the jobless and these cybersecurity issues. Not only that but this could put us on the map. We would be able to outsource our team to help other countries. This could stack up some revenue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after all send a thief to catch a thief?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Send a hacker to catch hackers, right ? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Kenya needs about 10,000 skilled cybersecurity professionals for a start. And an official cybersecurity division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the day, these are just the thoughts of one man. Ajulu's Thoughts 😎. History has proved to us, one man cannot change the world. So share this post and let us change the world! *some theme song should have been played here*</p>

<h3>ORGANIZATIONS</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> It’s important that organizations and their employees across Kenya are aware of the latest threats and how best to protect against them. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Train your people on the basics. Bring in white hackers to help conduct a drill. Hire hackers and let them attempt to hack, report and patch vulnerabilities. Setup honey pots. This can really improve the organization's security.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The past year has shown us the significant impact of botnet  infections on computers worldwide. We’ve seen cybercriminals leveraging  less sophisticated methods to infect machines and extort ransoms from  victims; and we’ve continued to encounter ransomware in a wide range of cybercrime activity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Organizations in Kenya that act quickly to adopt security solutions,  implement incident response plans and employ the right mix of people  will minimize damage and impact from cyber-attacks now and in the  future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Use an email security solution that scans suspicious email attachments  and ideally protects at the time a user clicks on an attachment.  Antivirus software should help detect and block the download and  installation of some ransomware but to mitigate against the impact of  sophisticated ransomware, additional protection is required. Advanced  threat protection that applies machine learning and artificial  intelligence technologies can help. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Be sure to create destruction-resistant backups of critical systems and  data. Also, be sure to regularly test that backups are working. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> To minimize entry points for ransomware, be sure to keep all software  updated, including operating systems, web browsers, plug-ins and  security software. Also prioritize patching new releases to enable  stronger protection against vulnerabilities. </p>
